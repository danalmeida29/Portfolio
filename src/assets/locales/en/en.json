I'm passionate about technology and games, but especially about web development. I volunteered for 2 years and 10 months as a Front-End Developer on a project for a senior care center; where I was responsible for creating responsive and functional screens for the project. Currently, I'm studying the React library and Next.js Framework and I plan to start studying the main Back-End programming languages and technologies to eventually become a Full-Stack Developer.",
