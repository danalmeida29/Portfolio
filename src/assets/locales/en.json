Soon, I will graduate in Systems Analysis and Development from Anhembi Morumbi University. I am passionate about technology and games, but especially about web development. For two years, I worked on a volunteer project for a senior care center, where I worked as a <i>Front-End</i> Developer, being primarily responsible for creating responsive and functional screens.</br> Currently, I am studying the <i>React</i> library and the <i>Next.js</i> Framework, and soon I will begin studying the main <i>Back-End</i> programming languages and technologies, aiming to become a <i>Full-Stack</i> developer.",
